# 🔬 PlantSwipe — Technical overview (for engineers)

The `plant-swipe` app is a React + Vite frontend with an Express API that serves `/api/*` and production static files. Data lives in Postgres (via Supabase). Client‑side uses only `VITE_*` env vars; server reads `DATABASE_URL`/`PG*` or Supabase host + `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`. Core features: swipe discovery (Framer Motion), typed plant models, search/filtering, and admin endpoints for branch listing, pulling latest, restarting the API, and schema sync. Dev runs two processes (`npm run serve`, `npm run dev`); build is `tsc -b && vite build`. Key directories: `src/components/ui` (shadcn‑inspired), `src/pages` (routes), `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` (Supabase auth), `src/lib` (supabase client, helpers), `supabase/` (SQL). See `server.js` and `vite.config.ts` for API routes and proxy. Built by Neolite & Five. 🌿
